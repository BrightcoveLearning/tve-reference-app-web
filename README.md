Brightcove TVE reference app for the web
=====================

**Note**: this reference app is open source -- the Adobe Pass technology is **not**.

The code could be run (almost) as is without the need to build, just be aware that the css/ui.css is a generated file built from css/ui.less.

## Prerequisite - Initial grunt setup
 1. Install node.js and npm (node.js package manager) from http://nodejs.org/
 1. Install grunt with all the required plugins by running `npm install`

## Build
The included gruntfile will generate a minimized build, which will also be linted before built by running the command `grunt` from the command-line

### See the **ReferenceApp[Web] - AuthFlow.pdf** doc for more information.
